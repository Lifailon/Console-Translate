# Console-Translate

PowerShell module for translating text directly in the console using Google/DeepL api and DeepLX

To translate using Google Translate, a **public API key** has been added to the module (default for the **-Key parameter**). To use your DeepL key, you must register on the **provider website** and create a token.
